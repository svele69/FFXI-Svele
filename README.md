# FFXI-Svele
Created a script which allows to autoattack in FFXI.
1st Try and in stage of testing

To use Farming I have added few functions which you can call in the Viewer:

//farming add <target name> - add a target to the list -> you can target a mob to add them to the target list
//farming remove <target name> - remove a target from the list  -> you can target a mob to remove them to the target list
//farming pull true/false - Pullmode on or off -> char will try to pull with the spell / ability customized
//farming spell - Dia / Provoke / ... -> Limited to Range,Dia,Bio,Flash,Provoke,hj(Hojo:Ni)],fq(Foe requiem VII)
//farming start - target the nearest target from the list -> Start the script
//farming save <set> - save current targets as a target set -> not tested yet
//farming load <set> - load a previously saved target set -> not tested yet
//farming list - list current targets
//farming help - display this help
//farming show - display the current settings 

Onmy list to do:
More Tests , missing pull spells except provoke to test
Clean up code
